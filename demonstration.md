## 1. Detection of Rogue Hotspots:

To detect rogue hotspots, you can use the airodump-ng tool to scan nearby Wi-Fi networks. Rogue hotspots can be identified by analyzing networks with unexpected or suspicious SSID (Wi-Fi names) or BSSIDs (unique identifiers). BSSIDs can be extracted from the output of airodump-ng.

## 2. Device Listing (Inventory Listing of Trusted Wi-Fi Hardware):

Maintain a list of trusted Wi-Fi devices (inventory) along with their MAC addresses (BSSIDs). This inventory can be stored in a file or a database. When scanning for Wi-Fi networks using airodump-ng, compare the BSSIDs of detected networks with the trusted devices in your inventory. Any network not matching the trusted devices can be considered a potential rogue hotspot.


## 3. De-Authentication of Rogue Hotspots:

If a rogue hotspot is detected (i.e., a network in the scan results that is not in the trusted inventory), you can use the aireplay-ng tool from the aircrack-ng suite to perform de-authentication attacks. This attack sends de-authentication packets to the rogue hotspot, disconnecting devices connected to it. This can be a proactive way to mitigate potential security threats.
Steps to Achieve the Goals:

    Start Monitor Mode:
    Use airmon-ng to enable monitor mode on the wireless network interface. Monitor mode allows the system to capture all wireless packets, essential for Wi-Fi analysis.

    Scan Wi-Fi Networks:
    Utilize airodump-ng to scan nearby Wi-Fi networks. Save the output to a file for further analysis. Extract SSID, BSSID, and other relevant information from the scan results.

    Manage Inventory:
    Maintain a trusted Wi-Fi device inventory. Store MAC addresses (BSSIDs) along with descriptions of each device. Update this inventory as new devices are added or removed.

    Analyze Scan Results:
    Read the output file generated by airodump-ng and extract BSSIDs of detected networks. Compare these BSSIDs with the trusted devices in your inventory.

    Identify Rogue Hotspots:
    Any BSSID not found in the trusted inventory can be considered a rogue hotspot. Note down its details for further action.

    De-Authentication Attack:
    Use aireplay-ng to perform de-authentication attacks on the rogue hotspot. Send de-authentication packets to the rogue network, disconnecting unauthorized devices.

Remember, while these tools and techniques can be used for security purposes, it's crucial to adhere to ethical hacking guidelines and obtain proper authorization before performing any security assessments on networks that you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
